            <em>Data Visualizations</em> explores how data from topics of personal interest, 
            often not inherently readable, can be transformed into exploratory visual narratives.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            <em>Japan Trip Depending on You</em> visualizes how my spending patterns in Japan 
            have changed since 2023 depending on who I travel with. The groups are divided into 
            friends, boyfriend, and family, and the spending categories include 
            Convenience Store, Goods Shop, Restaurant & Café, Transportation, and Tourism.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            The graphic style is inspired by DNA. 
            Just as DNA is composed of specific bases that combine into a coherent structure, 
            I saw a parallel between this structure and the relationship between travel groups and spending categories.
          </p>

          <p>
            The overall layout is inspired by receipts. 
            I adopted the mixed use of left-aligned, center-aligned, and right-aligned text commonly found on receipts. 
            The overall spending patterns are represented using a barcode-like format borrowed from receipts.
          </p>

          <p>
            All data collection began with scanning receipts and transferring the data into an XLSX file. 
            The graphics were generated as SVG files using 
            p5.js with JSON, HTML, JS, and CSS, and the final design was completed in Adobe Illustrator.
