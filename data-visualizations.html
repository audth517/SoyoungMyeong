            <em>Data Visualizations</em> is a project that transforms data from topics 
            I am personally interested in, data that is not inherently readable, into exploratory visual narratives.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            <em>Japan Trip Depending on You</em> visualizes how my spending patterns in Japan 
            have changed since 2023 depending on who I travel with. The groups are divided into 
            friends, boyfriend, and family, and the spending categories include 
            convenience stores, goods shops, restaurants & cafés, transportation, and tourism.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            The graphic style is inspired by DNA. 
            Just as DNA is composed of specific bases that come together to form a single compound, 
            I saw a parallel between this structure and the relationship between travel groups and spending categories.
          </p>

          <p>
            The overall layout is inspired by receipts. 
            I adopted the mixed use of left-aligned, center-aligned, and right-aligned text commonly found on receipts. 
            The overall spending patterns are represented using a barcode-like format borrowed from receipts.
          </p>

          <p>
            All data collection began with capturing my own receipts and transferring them into an XLSX file. 
            The data visualization graphics were generated as SVG files using 
            p5.js with data.json, index.html, sketch.js, and style.css, and the final design was completed in Adobe Illustrator.
