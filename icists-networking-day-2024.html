            <em>Redesign of Daily-Life Products</em> is a project that begins with 
            a product anatomy study and applies my own design style from 
            functional, aesthetic, and symbolic perspectives. 
            The outcome is presented as a set of rendered models that serve as communication materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, I selected a very inexpensive pencil sharpener that I had used in another class. 
            While it was compact and easy to carry, its drawer-style powder tray made it difficult to clean and maintain. 
            I looked to coffee grinders, which share a similar handle-turning mechanism and grind materials into powder, 
            as a reference to reinterpret the pencil sharpener’s design.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address the usability issue, I replaced the drawer-style tray with a twist-to-lock mechanism 
            that allows the container to be securely attached and easily detached by rotating it. 
            This approach improves both maintenance and user experience while staying true to the original hand-operated interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two color variations were rendered: pastel pink and pastel blue. 
            The materials of the redesigned components were based on the actual materials of the disassembled pencil sharpener 
            and were faithfully applied in the renderings. To make the sharpening process visible, 
            the lower powder container was designed to be transparent, 
            with a vertical transparent gradient applied from top to bottom.
          </p>
