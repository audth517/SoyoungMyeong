            <em>Infographics</em> is a project focused on creating a static, message-driven infographic based on a single topic.

            <em>The Ultimate Guide to Driving in Japan</em> is a driving guide for people 
            preparing to drive in Japan for the first time. In most countries around the world, 
            drivers sit on the left side of the car and drive on the right side of the road. 
            Japan, however, operates under the opposite system. Beyond this, 
            Japan’s traffic system differs in many ways from many countries, 
            making it essential to understand the driving rules and traffic environment in advance.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            I have driven rental cars in Japan several times. Based on this experience, 
            I organized essential information about the driver’s seat position and six key points 
            that are critical for driving in Japan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most commonly misunderstood driving position is used as the main hook, 
            while the guidance is presented in the form of road signs. 
            The graphic style adopts colors and illustrations reminiscent of Japanese animation. 
            Since first-time rental car experiences in Japan often begin in rural areas, 
            the background is illustrated as a countryside road.
